# <span style="color:crimson;">Telco Customer Churn Prediction

**<span style="color:crimson;">Business Problem**
    
Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or stop using a product. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones.  
We need to know: “Is this customer going to leave?” Yes or No? It is a binary classification task.

The data set includes information about:

* Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn 
* Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies 
* Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges 
* Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
